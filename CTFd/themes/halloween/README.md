# Halloween Theme

## 🎃 Cyber Haunt Event 🎃

### Event Description
Welcome to **Cyber Haunt** - a spine-chilling Halloween-themed cybersecurity challenge where the veil between the digital and supernatural worlds grows thin! 

👻 **The Legend:** Dark forces have unleashed the **Grim Reapers** into the cyber realm, and they're hunting for hidden souls scattered across the digital landscape. These souls manifest as **secret flags** hidden within various cybersecurity challenges. Only the bravest hackers can navigate through the haunted networks, decrypt cursed codes, and claim the souls before the Grim Reapers devour them!

🕷️ **Your Mission:** As a cyber ghost hunter, you must:
- Explore the haunted digital realms
- Solve cryptic Halloween-themed cybersecurity puzzles
- Discover and capture the hidden souls (flags) before they're lost forever
- Evade the lurking Grim Reapers who guard the most valuable secrets
- Rise through the ranks to become the ultimate Soul Collector

⚰️ **Warning:** The Grim Reapers grow stronger as midnight approaches. Each challenge becomes more sinister, each flag more elusive. Do you dare to enter the Cyber Haunt?
